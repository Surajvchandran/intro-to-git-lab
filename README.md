# intro-to-git-lab
This repository is for the version control lab assignment.

## Introduction
Hi my name is Suraj Vallanath Chandran. I am a great admirer of Linux systems and I like bash scripting.

## Project Overview
This project basically consists of creating a Github repository and modifying its sections like adding a file, editing the file, adding branch, creating pull requests.

## Key Concepts
- Version control is a system that helps manage changes to files over time. It's an essential tool in software development, enabling collaboration, tracking changes, and maintaining code history. Its is necessary to have version control to track changes, collaborate, backup and recovery.
- Git is essential for distributed architecture, branching and merging and performance as well.

## How to Run this Project
"git clone <repository url> will clone the repository to the local machine and by refreshing the github will show the contents edited in the cloned local machine.
