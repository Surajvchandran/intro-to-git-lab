## Version Control
Version control is a critical tool in software development that helps manage changes to files over time. It allows developers to track modifications made to the codebase, ensuring a clear history of all changes. It helps in understanding the evolution of the software. Collaboration is another significant benefit of version control. It enables multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other’s changes. Version control also provides robust backup and recovery mechanisms. In case of unexpected issues or bugs, developers can easily roll back to a previous stable version of the code. 

## Key Features of Git
Git is a distributed version control system DVCS designed to track changes in
source code. Its key features are -

- Distributed Architecture: Every user has a full copy of the repository,
including its history. This enables offline work and ensures no single point of
failure.
- Branching and Merging: Git makes it easy to create branches for independent
work. Changes can be merged back into the main branch seamlessly.
- Data Integrity: Uses cryptographic hashing to ensure the integrity of data.
- Performance: Optimized for speed, even with large repositories.
